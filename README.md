### The Medication Data Analysis is a comprehensive healthcare tool that allows users to explore medications for specific medical conditions. By selecting a condition, users can view a list of relevant medications and, upon clicking, access detailed insights such as the age group for which each medication is prescribed, the countries where it's commonly used, and gender distribution patterns in prescriptions. This tool is essential for patients, healthcare providers, and researchers, enabling them to make data-driven choices, understand global prescription trends, and tailor treatment plans more effectively.
